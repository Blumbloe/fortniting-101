      <h3>So what exactly is Fortnite?</h3>
      <p>Fortnite is an online video game and game platform developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. The game was originally just Fortnite: Save the World, 
        a PVE (Player-versus-environment) co-op experience, however due to the battle royale genre having a boom in popularity at the time 
        with games such as Player Unknowns Battleground (also known as P.U.B.G) seeing massive success. Epic Games decided they would
        take a crack at their own Battle Royale using Fortnite: Save the World as a template and created Fortnite: Battle Royale, which ended up
        becoming a global phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less than a year and earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month.
        As a whole, Fortnite has generated over $40 billion in total revenue to date!</p>

        <h3>What is there to do in Fortnite?</h3>
        <p>There is a plethora of things to do in Fortnite. Most notably are the aforementioned Battle Royale and Save the World modes
           (however, Save the World is a pay-to-play mode). But even if shooters are not your cup of tea, there are still other modes,
            such as Fortnite Festival (a rhythm game), Lego Fortnite Odyssey (open world survival), Rocket Racing (a racing game) and many more! 
            And there are even thousands of user-made experiences for you to try out.</p>

                  <h3>Battle Royale</h3>
                  <p>Fortnite Battle Royale is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing you to play alone, with a duo, a trio or a squad.
                    At the start of the game, you drop from the "Battle Bus" that will go from one side of the map to another. And then you loot up with weapons,
                      items and materials while eliminating other players. Over the course of the game, "The Storm", where players take damage and get eliminated 
                      if they stay there too long, shrinks around the map, pushing all the players closer together and resulting in more player encounters until the 
                      last player or team is alive. Alongside the main Battle Royale mode, there are three additional modes: Zero Build, which removes the building element 
                      Fortnite is known for and, in exchange, each player receives 50 rechargeable overshields, Reload, a more condensed map with only up to 40 players 
                      that allows players to respawn after dying for a set amount of time, and OG which revisits the classic chapter 1 map and lootpool.</p>

                  <p>Fortnite Festival is a rhythm game consisting of three modes, the most popular being "Main Stage", where players can
                  play hit songs and original tracks made by Epic Games themselves, each day having up to 40 different songs to choose from.
                  There are four unique instruments: Lead, Bass, Drums and Vocals. There is also the "Battle Stage" where sixteen players 
                  fight over who can get the highest score whilst trying to sabotage each other's performance until only one player remains.
                  On the "Jam Stage", players work together to make remixes using different instruments of different songs. </p>

                  build various structures and craft weapons and items to fend off the many enemies. Brick Life is a social-based game

                  come in various shapes and sizes. Rewards from missions include hero characters, schematics for weapons and traps, and survivors which 
                  can all be leveled up through experience.

                  Between each round there is a "buy phase" where players are able to buy in-game weapons and gear using the currency they earned in the
                  previous rounds.
