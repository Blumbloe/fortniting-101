## Fixing Bugs

Throughout the development of the site I have been consistently checking for bugs or issues in the code some of those issues are as followed:

- The carousel was not interactable and the solution I found was to change the type of carousel I was using from bootstrap which then gave it interactivity.

- When clicking on the navbar buttons to go to the different sections of the page the navbar would overlap the section heading. To remedy this I added some padding to the top of the sections so that the navbar would not cover up the headings

- I had to rename the assets folder which resulted in the github page folder and the VS-code folder being disjointed which I fixed by renaming the github page folder in the github editor.

- I also had issues with the images in the gamemode section appearing under the images respective text on large screen sizes when they were supposed to be beside one another. To solve this issue I added a div with a class of "row" to each of the divs containing the images and text so that the image would be on the same level as the text.

- Due to the deadline of the project I was unable to fix every bug as i had to prioritise the major bugs. As a result I was unable to fix the issue of the favicon not showing up on the site.
